! (factorial | product-of-combinations) is = "n!" where
    the ! is: "xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₁₎*xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₂₎*xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₃₎*…*xₙ₋₁*xₙ". For exam-
    -ple: "5!" is "1*2*3*4*5". ∴ "5!" is 120. Note: "xₙ₋ₙ" is
    invalid ∵ n*0 is still 0. "xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₁₎" can be replaced with "1".
% ()
() (precedance | open-interval | set-not-including) is
    doing the expressions inside the () first. For example:
    (8/4)/2 is 2/2 which is 1, but 8/(4/2) is 8/2 which is 4.
    Or it can be = "(a, b)" where they are ∈ {a < x < b}.
    For example: 4 ∨ 18 ∉ (4, 18) but 5 ∧ 17 is, & (0, ∞) ∈ ℕ⁺.
* (multiplication | times)
+ (addition | plus | sum) is adding the values of at least two ∈ ℝ,
    adding the latter to the former. For example: a + b = c, where
    a and b are known or substitutable ∈ ℝ, and c is the sum of both.
- (negative | additive inverse | +′) is the ¬ of a ℝ number.
    For example: -3 is 6 ∈ ℝ to the left of the number line from
    3. Or another ex: -(-5) is a double-negative, +″, or  -′;
    so it is 5 ∈ ℝ to the right of the number line from 0.

< (less than)
= (equal to)
[] (closed-interval | set-including) is = "[a, b]"
    where they are ∈ {a ≤ x ≤ b}.

± (plus-minus | bi-solutional | degree-of-certainty | ±°) is either 2 solutions
    from a ⁿ√ₓ, or a ° of certainty. For example: 7 ± ²√₂₅ = 7+5 and 7−5.
    ∴ the solution is = 2 and | or 12 only. Or another ex: 7 ± 5 = [2, 12].
² (superscript two | squared)
³ (superscript three | cubed)
¹ (superscript one | itself)
× (multiplication | multiply | product) is multiplying the values of at least two
    ∈ ℝ, multiplying the latter to the former. For example: a × b = c, where
    a and b are known or substitutable ∈ ℝ, and c is the product of both.
    Also called adding the former with itself, for latter times, or called
    creating latter copies of the former.
÷ (division | divide | quotient) is dividing the values of at least two ∈ ℝ,
    dividing the former by the latter. For example: c ÷ b = a, where
    c and b are known or substitutable ∈ ℝ, and a is the ratio, or ∶, of both.
    Also called dividing the former into latter segments, parts or pieces.

    the ∏ is: "xₘ*xₘ₊₁*xₘ₊₂*…*xₙ₋₁*xₙ". For example:
