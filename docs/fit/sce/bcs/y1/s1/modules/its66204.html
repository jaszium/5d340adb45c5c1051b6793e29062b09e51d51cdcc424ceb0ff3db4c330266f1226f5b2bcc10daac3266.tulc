! (factorial | product-of-combinations) is = "n!" where
    the ! is: "xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₁₎*xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₂₎*xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₃₎*…*xₙ₋₁*xₙ". For exam-
    -ple: "5!" is "1*2*3*4*5". ∴ "5!" is 120. Note: "xₙ₋ₙ" is
    invalid ∵ n*0 is still 0. "xₙ₋₍ₙ₋₁₎" can be replaced with "1".
% ()
() (precedance | open-interval | set-not-including) is
    doing the expressions inside the () first. For example:
    (8/4)/2 is 2/2 which is 1, but 8/(4/2) is 8/2 which is 4.
    Or it can be = "(a, b)" where they are ∈ {a < x < b}.
    For example: 4 ∨ 18 ∉ (4, 18) but 5 ∧ 17 is, & (0, ∞) ∈ ℕ⁺.
* (multiplication | times)
+ (addition | plus | sum) is adding the values of at least two ∈ ℝ,
    adding the latter to the former. For example: a + b = c, where
    a and b are known or substitutable ∈ ℝ, and c is the sum of both.
- (negative | additive inverse | +′) is the ¬ of a ℝ number.
    For example: -3 is 6 ∈ ℝ to the left of the number line from
    3. Or another ex: -(-5) is a double-negative, +″, or  -′;
    so it is 5 ∈ ℝ to the right of the number line from 0.
/ (solidus | divided by)
< (less than)
= (equal to)
[] (closed-interval | set-including) is = "[a, b]"
    where they are ∈ {a ≤ x ≤ b}.
{}(defined-interval | set)
> (more than)
| (absolute | modulus) is the ℕ of |x|. For example: |−3| is 3 units of measure.
¬ (not | negation)
° (degree)
± (plus-minus | bi-solutional | degree-of-certainty | ±°) is either 2 solutions
    from a ⁿ√ₓ, or a ° of certainty. For example: 7 ± ²√₂₅ = 7+5 and 7−5.
    ∴ the solution is = 2 and | or 12 only. Or another ex: 7 ± 5 = [2, 12].
² (superscript two | squared)
³ (superscript three | cubed)
¹ (superscript one | itself)
× (multiplication | multiply | product) is multiplying the values of at least two
    ∈ ℝ, multiplying the latter to the former. For example: a × b = c, where
    a and b are known or substitutable ∈ ℝ, and c is the product of both.
    Also called adding the former with itself, for latter times, or called
    creating latter copies of the former.
÷ (division | divide | quotient) is dividing the values of at least two ∈ ℝ,
    dividing the former by the latter. For example: c ÷ b = a, where
    c and b are known or substitutable ∈ ℝ, and a is the ratio, or ∶, of both.
    Also called dividing the former into latter segments, parts or pieces.
π (greek letter pi constant) is ≈ 3.14159 or ≈ ²²⁄₇ or
    the ratio circumference ∶ ⌀ of any circle
… (triple-dot | ellipsis) is omitted values from a pattern.
′ (inverse)rati
″ (original or inverse of an inverse)

    expressible fractions}
ℚ′ (d-s Q prime | irrationals) are ∈ {ⁿ√ₓ: x are ∈ {
    ℚ-ℤ+ℕ or ℝ−ℚ}, and n: nth root of x} ∪ {x: x are
    constants of {ⅇ, γ, δ, ε, θ, λ, μ, ν, π, ρ, σ, τ, φ, ω}}
ℤ (d-s Z | integers) are ∈ (−∞, −1] ∪ ℕ

ℤ* (d-s Z asterisk | integers except 0) are ∈ (−∞, −1] ∪ ℕ⁺
ⅆ ()
ⅇ ()
ⅈ (imaginary)
∀ (for all | for any | for each | universal quantifier)
∁ (complement set of) is A′, Aᶜ, or ∉ A. Ex: If A ∈ {
    x: x are even ℤ}, then A′ (Aᶜ) are ∈ {x: x are odd ℤ}.
∂ (partial differential)
∃ (there exists some | existential quantifier)
∃! (there exists only one | unique existential quantifier)
∄ (there does not exist) is ¬∃
∅ (empty set) 
∈ (element of)
∉ (not ∈) is ¬∈
∎ (QED | end-of-proof | finality) is used
    to mark the end of any proof.
∏ (product-of-factors | production) is = "ᵢ₌ₘ∏ⁿ xᵢ" where
    the ∏ is: "xₘ*xₘ₊₁*xₘ₊₂*…*xₙ₋₁*xₙ". For example:
    "ᵢ₌₁∏⁴ x" is "1*2*3*4". ∴ "ᵢ₌₁∏⁴ xᵢ" is 24.

∑ (sum-of-factors | summation) is = "ᵢ₌ₘ∑ⁿ xᵢ" where the
    ∑ is: "xₘ+xₘ₊₁+xₘ₊₂+…+xₙ₋₁+xₙ". For example:
    "ᵢ₌₁∑⁵ 2x" is "2+4+6+8+10". ∴ "ᵢ₌₁∑⁵ 2xᵢ" is 30. Or
    another ex: "ᵢ₌₃∑⁵ x²" is "3²+4²+5²". ∴ "ᵢ₌₃∑⁵ x²ᵢ" is 50.
    Another formula can be: "ᵢ₌₁∑ⁿ xᵢ" = ⁿ⁽ⁿ⁺¹⁾⁄₂.
− (subtraction | minus) is removing the value from at least one of two or more
    ∈ ℝ, taking away the latter from the former. For example: c − b = a, where
    c and b are known or substitutable ∈ ℝ, and a is the difference of both.

∜ (fourth root) is = ⁴√ₓ x: radicand, n: 4th root of x.
∝ (proportional to) is "y ∝ x" where y = kx. For
    example: If y = 2x, then y ∝ x, ∴ k is 2.
∞ (infinity | no-limit-bounds)
∟ (right angle) is = 90°.
∠ (acute angle) is < 90°.
∣ (divides) is "x∣y" where x is a factor of b. For example: 3∣15.
∤ (does not ∣) is "x∤y" where x is not a factor of b. For example: 4∤10.
∥ (parallel to) has variants: ⫲ and ⫳ which mean the same: ∥. It is "x∥y"
    where the x° and y° are the same. Or, If x∥y and y ∟ z, then x ∟ z.
∦ (not ∥) is "x∦y" where the x° and y° are such that x and y intersect.

∨ (or | either)
∩ (intersection)
